Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and his psychology professor.Professor: Good afternoon, Alex.Can I help you with something?Man: Well, I wanted to talk with you about the research project you assigned today.I, um, hope you could clarify a few things for me.Professor: I'll certainly try.Man: OK, all we have to do is do two observations and take notes on them, right?Professor: Oh, that's a start, but you'll need to do some research, too.Then you'll write a paper that's not so much about the observations but a synthesis of what you observed and read.Man: OK, and what about the children I am supposed to observe?Professor: Not children, a single child observed twice.Man: Oh, OK! So I should choose a child, with the permission of the child's parents, of course, and then observe that child a couple of times and take good notes, then?Professor: Actually, after your first observation, you'll go back and look through your textbook or go to the library and find a few sources concerning the stage of development this particular child is in.And then, with that knowledge, you'll make a second observation of the same child to see if the expected developmental behaviors are exhibited.Man: Can you give me an example?Professor: Well, uh, if you observe a four-year-old child, uh, for example, my daughter's four years old, you might read up on Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development.We covered those in class.Man: Uh huh.Professor: Most likely, what stage would a child of that age be in?Man: Um, the pre-operational stage?Professor: Exactly! If that's the case, her language use would be maturing and her memory and imagination would be developed.Man: So she might play pretend, like she can pretend when driving her toy car across the couch that the couch is actually a bridge or something.Professor: That's right!In addition, her thinking would be primarily egocentric.Man: So she'd be thinking mostly about herself and her own needs and might not be able to see things from anyone else's perspective?Professor: Um hmm.Man: But, what if she doesn't?I mean, what if she doesn't demonstrate those behaviors?Professor: That's fine.You'll note that in your paper.See, your paper should compare what is expected of children at certain stage of development with what you actually observe.Man: OK. I have one more question, though.Professor: And what's that?Man: Where can I find a child to observe?Professor: Um, I'd suggest you contact the Education Department secretary.She has a list of contacts of various schools and with certain families who are somehow connected to the University.Sometimes they are willing to help out students with projects like yours.Man: OK, I'll stop by the Education Department Office this afternoon.Professor: And if you have any trouble or any more questions, feel free to come by during my office hours.
