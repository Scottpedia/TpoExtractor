# TPO EXTRACTOR

This project is dedicated to dump the internal database of TPO application developed by [zhan.com](http://zhan.com), and release all the TOEFL reading passages in the format of Microsoft Work document found in the database.

This project is currently **inactive**, and is not expecting any contributions. However, if you are interested in the source code, you are welcome to clone this repository and use it as you like, subject to certain [terms and conditions](#LICENSE).

The database as I mentioned contains almost all the data, or the links to the data, that are used by the TPO application. That includes **listening materials in the form of audio recording**, **listening transcripts**, **translation of the listening transcripts**, etc. It's totally technically possible to dump all of them in the form of readable format(e.g. html, MS word document). This project has only extracted the **reading passages** from this database.

In case the company decides to modify the future release of TPO application such that this program can no longer be used. The TPO application from which the database used in this project is extracted from has already been archived by the wayback machine.

**The point of this project** is to fight back against the profit-oriented education industry in China, especially for students who want to study abroad. According to my experiences, these "English training" companies care about nothing but profit. And they often times do so by spreading misinformation, charging parents extensively for doing nothing. As a result, people are either discouraged from learning English, or misguided in the process of learning English. The company that developed the TPO application is part of that money-making industry. 

For how to re-generate the word documents with source code. Please see the [latest release note](https://github.com/Scottpedia/TpoExtractor/releases). If you want to know more details about how this program works, you can get in touch with me by [email](#author-and-license).
