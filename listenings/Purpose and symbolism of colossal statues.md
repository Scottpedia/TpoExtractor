# Purpose and symbolism of colossal statues

Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class.The professor has been talking about colossal statues.Professor:
 We've been looking at colossal statues-works of exceptionally huge 
size-and their essentially public role, in commemorating a political or 
religious figure.We‘ve seen how some of these statues date 
back thousands of years …like the statues of the pharaohs of ancient 
Egypt-which you can still visit today-and how others, though surviving 
only in legend, have fired the imagination of writers and artists right 
up to our own time, such as the Colossus of Rhodes, that 110-foot statue
 of the Greek god Helios.Remember, this same word, 
colossus-which means a giant or larger-than-life-size statue-is what 
today's term colossal derives from.Now, it was one 
thing to build such statues, at an equally colossal cost, when the funds
 were being allocated by ancient kings and pharaohs.But if 
we're going to think about modern-day colossal statues, we need to 
reexamine more closely their role as social and political symbols, in 
order to understand why a society today-a society of free, taxpaying 
citizens-would agree to allocate so much of its resources to erecting 
them.A good example to start out with would be Mount 
Rushmore.Now, many of you have probably seen pictures of 
Mount Rushmore; perhaps you've actually visited the place.Mount Rushmore, in South Dakota, is a colossal representation 
of the faces of four U.S. Presidents: George Washington, Thomas 
Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, carved directly into
 a mountain.Imagine: each of those faces in the rock is over 
60 feet high! Now, carving their faces took over six and a half years, 
and cost almost a million dollars.And this was in the 1930s, 
during the worst economic depression in U.S. history!Does 
that strike any of you as odd?Well, I personally 
think that the Great Depression of the 1930s actually makes this more 
understandable, not less so.Often it’s the case that, 
precisely at times of hardship-when the very fabric of society seems to 
be unraveling and confidence is eroding-uh, that people clamor for some 
public expression of strength and optimism, perhaps as a way of 
symbolizing its endurance in the face of difficulty.So
 with that in mind, let's go back to Mount Rushmore.Actually,
 the original motivation for a colossal monument in South Dakota had 
very little to do with all this symbolism ... and everything to do with 
money: you see, it was first conceived of basically as a tourist 
attraction, and it was supposed to feature the images of legendary 
figures of the American West like the explorers Lewis and Clark.The government of South Dakota thought it would bring lots of 
money into the state.It was only later on that the 
sculptor-the artist who designed and oversaw the project, a man named 
Gutzon Borglum-decided the project should be a monument honoring four of
 the most-respected Presidents in U.S. history; much more than a tourist
 attraction ... its very prominence and permanence became perceived as a
 symbol of the endurance of U.S. ideals and the greatness of the 
country's early leaders.So, you see, what began as a tourist 
attraction became something far loftier.Let’s look at another example of this phenomenon.The
 Statue of Liberty is another colossal statue-one that I assume a 
number of you are familiar with.But, umm, I would guess 
that-like many people today-you don’t realize that, when it was 
designed, over a century ago-by a French sculptor-it was intended to 
symbolize the long friendship between the people of France and the 
people of the United States-one which dated back to France's support of 
the American colonies' war for independence from the British.But
 the shift in the statue's meaning started soon after it was built.Back in 1883, Emma Lazarus wrote that famous poem-you know, 
the one that goes: "Give me your tired, your poor... and so on and so 
forth.That poem describes the Statue of Liberty as a beacon 
of welcome for the entire world.Well, in the early 1900s, it 
was put on a plaque on the pedestal that the Statue of Liberty stands 
on.From that point on, the Statue of Liberty was no 
longer perceived as just a gift between friendly republics.It
 now became a tribute to the United States' history of immigration and 
openness.This association was strengthened in the 
imagination of the general public just a few decades after the statue's 
completion, with the immigration waves of the early twentieth century 
... especially since the statue happened to be the first sign of America
 seen by those immigrants sailing into the port of New York.So, as with Mount Rushmore, the original motivation for this 
colossal statue was forgotten, and the statue is now valued for more 
important reasons.
