Groundwater is the word used to describe water that saturates the ground, filling all the available spaces. ●By far the most abundant type of groundwater is meteoric water; this is the groundwater that circulates as part of the water cycle. ●Ordinary meteoric water is water that has soaked into the ground from the surface, from precipitationand from lakes and streams. ●There it remains, sometimes for long periods, before emerging at the surface again. ●At first thought it seems {that there can be enough space in the “solid” ground underfoot to hold all this water.{The necessary space is there, however, in many forms. ●The commonest spaces are those among the particles—sand grains and tiny pebbles—of loose, unconsolidated sand and gravel. ●Beds of this material, {beneath the soil, are common. ●They are found wherever fast rivers carrying loads of coarse sediment once flowed. ●For example, as the great ice sheets that covered North America during the last ice age steadily melted away, huge volumes of water flowed from them. ●The water was always laden with pebbles, gravel, and sand, known as {, that was deposited as the flow slowed down.{The same thing happens to this day, though on a smaller scale, wherever a sediment-laden river or stream emerges from a mountain valley onto relatively flat land, dropping its load as the current slows: the water usually spreads out fanwise, depositing the sediment in the form of a smooth, fan-shaped slope. ●Sediments are also dropped where a river slows on entering a lake or the sea, the deposited sediments are on a lake floor or the seafloor at first, but will be located inland at some future date, when the sea level falls or the land rises; such beds are sometimes thousands of meters thick.In lowland country almost any spot on the ground may {what was once the bed of a river that has since become buried by soil; if they are now below the water’s upper surface, the gravels and sands of the former riverbed, and its sandbars, will be saturated with groundwater.{unconsolidated sediments. Consolidatedsediments, too, contain millions of minute water-holding pores. ●This is because the gaps among the original grains are often not totally {with cementing chemicals; also, parts of the original grains may become dissolved by percolating groundwater, either while consolidation is taking place or at any time afterwards. ●The result is that sandstone, for example, can be as porous as the loose sand from which it was formed.{Thus a proportion of the total volume of any sediment, loose or cemented, consists of empty space. ●Most crystalline rocks are much more solid; a common exception is basalt, a form of solidified volcanic lava, which is sometimes full of tiny bubbles that make it very porous.{{The proportion of empty space in a rock is known as its porosity. ●But note that porosity is not the same as permeability, which measures the ease with which water can flow through a material; this depends on the sizes of the individual cavities and the crevices linking them.{Much of the water in a sample of water-saturated sediment or rock will drain from it if the sample is put in a suitable dry place. ●{But some will remain, clinging to all solid surfaces. ●{It is held there by the force of surface tension without which water would drain instantly from any wet surface, leaving it totally dry. ●{The total volume of water in the saturated sample must therefore be thought of as consisting of water that can, and water that cannot, drain away.{The relative amount of these two kinds of water varies greatly from one kind of rock or sediment to another, even though their porosities may be the same. ●What happens depends on pore size.
