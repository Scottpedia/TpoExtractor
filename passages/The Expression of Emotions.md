Joy and sadness are experienced by people in all cultures around the world, but how can we tell when other people are happy or {?● It turns out that the expression of many emotions may be universal.● Smiling is apparently a universal sign of friendliness and approval.● {, as noted by Charles Darwin in the nineteenth century, may be a universal sign of anger.● As the originator of the theory of evolution, Darwin believed that the universal recognition of facial expressions would have survival value.● For example, facial expressions could signal the approach of enemiesin the absence of language.{{{Most investigators {that certain facial expressions suggest the same emotions in all people.● {Moreover, people in diverse cultures recognize the emotions manifested by the facial expressions.● {In classic research Paul Ekman took photographs of people exhibiting the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness.● {He then asked people around the world to indicate what emotions were being depicted in {.● Those queried ranged from European college students to members of the Fore, a tribe that dwells in the New Guinea highlands.● All groups, including the Fore, who had almost no contact with Western culture, agreed on the portrayed emotions.● {● Ekman and his colleagues more recently obtained similar results in a study of ten cultures in which participants were permitted to report that multiple emotions were shown by facial expressions.● The participants generally agreed on which two emotions were being shown and which emotion was more intense.{Psychological researchers generally recognize that facial expressions reflect emotional states.● In fact, various emotional states give rise to certain patterns of electrical activity in the facial muscles and in the brain.● The facial-feedback hypothesis argues, however, that the causal relationship between emotions and facial expressions can also work in the opposite direction.● According to this hypothesis, signals from the facial musclesare sent back to emotion centers of the brain, and so a person's facial expression can influence that person's emotional state.● Consider Darwin's words: ""The free expression by outward signs of an emotion intensifies it.● On the other hand, the repression, as far as possible, of all outward signs softens our emotions.●"" Can smiling give rise to feelings of good will, for example, and frowning to anger?{Psychological research has given rise to some interesting findings concerning the facial-feedback hypothesis.● Causing participants in experiments to smile, for example, leads them to report more positive feelings and to {] cartoonsas being more humorous.● When they are caused to frown, they rate cartoons as being more aggressive.What are the possible links between facial expressions and emotion?● One link is arousal, which is the level of activity or preparedness for activity in an organism.● Intense contraction of facial muscles, such as those used in signifying fear, heightens arousal.● Self-perception of heightened arousal then leads to heightened emotional activity.● Other links may involve changes in brain temperature and the release of neurotransmitters.● The contraction of facial muscles both influences the internal emotional state and reflects it.● Ekman has found that the so-called Duchenne smile, which is characterized by ''crow’s feet"" wrinkles around the eyes and a subtle drop in the eye cover fold so that the skin above the eye moves down slightly toward the eyeball, can lead to pleasant feelings.Ekman’s observation may be {to the British expression “keep a stiff upper lip” as a recommendation for handling stress.● It might be that a “stiff” lip suppresses emotional response -- as long as the lip is not quivering with fear or tension.● But when the emotion that leads to stiffening the lip is more intense, and involves strong muscle tension, facial feedback may heighten emotional response.
