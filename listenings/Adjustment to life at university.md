Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a counselor at the University Counseling Center.Student: Hi, thanks for seeing me on such short notice.Counselor: No problem. How can I help?Student: Well, I think I might have made a mistake coming to the school.Counselor: What makes you say that?Student: I'm a little overwhelmed by the size of this place.I come from a small town.There were only 75 of us in my high school graduating class.Everyone knew everyone.We all grew up together.Counselor: So it's a bit of a culture shock for you?Being one of 15,000 students on a big campus in an unfamiliar city?Student: That's an understatement.I just can't get comfortable in class or in the dorms.You know, socially.Counselor: Ummm...well, let's start with your academics.Tell me about your classes.Student: I'm taking mostly introductory courses and some are taught in these huge lecture halls.Counselor: And you are having trouble in keeping pace with the material?Student: No, in fact I got an A on my first economics paper.It's just that, it's so impersonal, I'm not used to it.Counselor: Are all your classes impersonal?Student: No, it's just that...for example, in sociology yesterday, the professor asked a question, so I raised my hand, several of us raised our hands.And I kept my hand up because I did the reading and knew the answer.But the professor just answered his own question and continued with the lecture.Counselor: Well, in a big room it's possible he didn't notice you.Maybe he was trying to save time.In either case I wouldn't take it personally.Student: I suppose. But I just don't know how to, you know, distinguish myself.Counselor: Why not stop by his office during office hours?Student: That wouldn't seem right.You know, taking time from other students who need help?Counselor: Don't say that.That's what office hours are for.There is no reason you couldn't pop in to say hi and to make yourself known.If you are learning a lot in class, let the professor know.Wouldn't you appreciate positive feedback if you were a professor?Student: You are right.That's a good idea.Counselor: OK, er...let's turn to your social life.How's it going in the dorms?Student: I don't have much in common with my roommate or anyone else I've met so far.Everyone's into sports and I'm more artsy, you know, into music.I play the cello.Counselor: Hah, have you been playing long?Student: Since age ten.It's a big part of my life.At home I was the youngest member of our community orchestra.Counselor: You are not going to believe this.There is a string quartet on campus, all students.And it so happened that the cellist graduated last year.They've been searching high and low for a replacement, someone with experience.Would you be interested in auditioning?Student: Absolutely. I wanted to get my academic work settled before pursuing my music here.But I think this would be a good thing for me.I guess if I really want to fit in here I should find people who love music as much as I do.Thank you.Counselor: My pleasure.
