Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a business professor.Pro: So, Richard... what’s up?Stu: Well, I know we have a test coming up on chapters, um…Pro: Chapters 3 and 4 from your textbook.Stu: Right, 3 and 4.Well, I didn’t get something you said in class Monday.Pro: Alright.Do you remember what it was about?Stu: Yeah, you were talking about a gym... a health club where people can go to exercise, that kind of thing.Pro: Ok, but the health club model is actually from chapter 5, so…Stu: Oh, chapter 5?Oh so it not... OK, but I guess I still want to try to understand…Pro: Of course.Well, I was talking about an issue in strategic marketing, the health club model; I mean with a health club you might think they would have trouble attracting customers, right?Stu: Well, I know when I pass by a health club and I see all those people working out.They’re exercising.I just as soon walk on by.Pro: Yes, there is that.Plus, lots of people have exercise equipment at home, or they can play sports with their friends. Right?Stu: Sure.Pro: But nowadays, in spite of all that, and expensive membership fees, health clubs are hugely popular, so how come?Stu: I guess that is what I didn’t understand.Pro: Ok, basically they have to offer things that most people can’t find anywhere else –quality.That means better exercise equipment, high-end stuff, and classes... exercise classes, maybe aerobics.Stu: I am not sure if I…ok I get it. Yeah.And you know another thing is I think people probably feel good about themselves when they are at the gym.And they can meet new people, socialize.Pro: Right, so health clubs offer high quality facilities.And also they sell an image about people having more fun, relating better to others and improving their own lives if they become members.Stu: Sure, that makes sense.Pro: Well, then, can you think of another business or organization that could benefit from doing this?Stu: Um…Pro: Think about an important building on campus here, something everyone uses, a major source of information.Stu: You mean like an administrative building?Pro: Well, that’s not what I had in mind.Stu: Oh, you mean the library!Pro: Exactly, libraries.Imagine public libraries; they’re an information resource for the whole community, right?Stu: Well, they can be, but now with the internet and big book stores, you can probably get what you need without going to a library.Pro: That’s true.So if you were the director of a public library, what would you do about that?Stu: To get more people to stop in?Well, like you said, better equipment, maybe a super-fast internet connection, and not just a good variety of books, but also like nice comfortable areas where people can read and do research.Things that make them want to come to the library and stay.Pro: Great!Stu: Oh, and maybe have authors come and do some readings or ... I don’t know, special presentations.Something people couldn’t get at home.Pro: Now, you are getting it.Stu: Thanks, Professor Wilkins. I think too.
