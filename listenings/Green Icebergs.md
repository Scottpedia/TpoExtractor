{Icebergs are massive blocks of ice, irregular in shape; they float with only about 12 percent of their mass above the sea surface.● They are formed by glaciers—large rivers of ice that begin inland in the snows of Greenland, Antarctica, and Alaska—and move slowly toward the sea.● The forward movement, the melting at the base of the glacier where it meets the ocean, and waves and tidal action cause blocks of ice to break off and float out to sea.{{Icebergs are ordinarily blue to white, although they sometimes appear dark or opaque because they carry gravel and bits of rock.● They may change color with changing light conditions and cloud cover, glowing pink or gold in the morning or evening light, but this color change is generally related to the low angle of the Sun above the horizon.● {However, travelers to Antarctica have repeatedly reported seeing green icebergs in the Weddell Sea and, more commonly, close to the Amery Ice Shelf in East Antarctica.{{{● {Another suggestion is that the color might be related to ice with high levels of metallic compounds, including copper and iron.● {Recent expeditions have taken ice samples from green icebergs and ice cores—vertical, cylindrical ice samples reaching down to great depths—from the glacial ice shelves along the Antarctic continent.● Analyses of these cores and samples provide a different solution to the problem.{{The ice shelf cores, with a total length of 215 meters, were long enough to {through glacial ice—which is formed from the compaction of snow and contains air bubbles—and to continue into the clear, bubble-free ice formed from seawater that freezes onto the bottom of the glacial ice.● The properties of this clear sea ice were very similar to the ice from the green iceberg.● The scientists concluded that green icebergs form when a two-layer block of shelf ice breaks away and capsizes, exposing the bubble-free shelf ice that was formed from seawater.A green iceberg that stranded just west of the Amery Ice Shelf showed two distinct layers: bubbly blue-white ice and bubble-free green ice separated by a one-meter- long ice layer containing sediments.● {.● Where cracks were present, the color was light green because of light scattering; where no cracks were present, the color was dark green.● No air bubbles were present in the green ice, suggesting that the ice was not formed from the compression of snow but instead from the freezing of seawater.● Large concentrations of single-celled organisms with green pigmentsoccur along the edges of the ice shelves in this region, and the seawater is rich in their decomposing organic material.● The green iceberg did not contain large amounts of particles from these organisms, but the ice had {dissolved organic matter from the seawater.● It appears that unlike salt, dissolved organic substances are not {from the ice in the freezing process.● Analysis shows that the dissolved organic material absorbs enough blue wavelengths from solar light to make the ice appear green.{{Chemical evidence shows that plateletsof ice form in the water and then {and stick to the bottom of the ice shelf to form a slush.● The slush is compacted by an unknown mechanism, and solid, bubblefree ice is formed from water high in soluble organic substances.● When an iceberg separates from the ice shelf and capsizes, the green ice is exposed.The Amery Ice Shelf appears to be uniquely suited to the production of green icebergs.● Once detached from the ice shelf, these bergs drift in the currents and wind systems surrounding Antarctica and can be found scattered among Antarctica’s less colorful icebergs.
