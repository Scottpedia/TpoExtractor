{Most people consider the landscape to be unchanging, but Earth is a dynamic body, and its surface is continually altering-slowly on the human time scale, but {rapidly when compared to the great age of Earth.● There are two principal influences that shape the terrain: constructive processes such as uplift, which create new landscape features, and destructive forces such as erosion, which gradually wear away exposed landforms.{{● As a general rule, the higher a mountain is, the more recently it was formed; for example, the high mountains of the Himalayas are only about 50 million years old.● Lower mountains tend to be older, and are often the eroded {of much higher mountain chains.● About 400 million years ago, when the present-day continents of North America and Europe were joined, the Caledonian mountain chain was the same size as the modern Himalayas.● Today, however, the relics of the Caledonian orogenyexist as the comparatively low mountains of Greenland, the northern Appalachians in the United States, the Scottish Highlands, and the Norwegian coastal plateau.{The Earth's crust is thought to be divided into huge, movable segments, called plates, which float on a soft plastic layer of rock.● Some mountains were formed as a result of these plates crashing into each other and forcing up the rock at the plate margins.● In this process, sedimentary rocks that originally formed on the seabed may be folded upwards to altitudes of more than 26,000 feet.● Other mountains may be raised by earthquakes, which fracture the Earth's crust and can displace enough rock to produce block mountains.● A third type of mountain may be formed as a result of volcanic activity which occurs in regions of active fold mountain belts, such as in the Cascade Range of western North America.● The Cascades are made up of lavas and volcanic materials.● Many of the peaks are extinct volcanoes.Whatever the reason for mountain formation, as soon as land rises above sea level it is subjected to destructive forces.● The exposed rocks are attacked by the various weather processes and gradually broken down into fragments, which are then carried away and later deposited as sediments.● Thus, any landscape represents only a temporary stage in the continuous battle between the forces of uplift and those of erosion.{The weather, in its many forms, is the main agent of erosion.● Rain washes away loose soil and penetrates cracks in the rocks.● Carbon dioxide in the air reacts with the rainwater, forming a weak acidthat may chemically attack the rocks.● The rain {underground and the water may reappear later as springs.● These springs are the sources of streams and rivers, which cut through the rocks and carry away debris from the mountains to the lowlands.{{Under very cold conditions, rocks can be shattered by ice and frost.● Glaciers may form in permanently cold areas, and these slowly moving masses of ice cut out valleys, carrying with {huge quantities of eroded rock debris.● {In dry areas the wind is the principal agent of erosion.●{It carries fine particles of sand, which bombard exposed rock surfaces, thereby wearing them into yet more sand.● {Even living things contribute to the formation of landscapes.●{Tree roots force their way into cracks in rocks and, in so doing, speed their splitting.● In contrast, the roots of grasses and other small plants may help to hold loose soil fragments together, thereby helping to prevent erosion by the wind.
