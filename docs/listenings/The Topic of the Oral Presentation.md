Narrator:Listen to a conversation between a student and his environmental science professor.Student:Hi, Professor Williams.I’m here for our 1:30 meeting.Professor:Hi Michael.Thanks for being so prompt.That really makes a difference when I have so many students scheduled back to back.If only there could be more than 24 hours in a day.Student:I know what you mean.Professor:So, what’s on your mind?Student:Well, I’m here about my topic choice.Professor:For the upcoming oral presentation?By the way, how do you feel about speaking in front of the class?Student:Well I’d have to say I’m most comfortable writing papers, but I’m not nervous about doing this presentation.It’ll be good public speaking practice you know.Professor:Exactly, and certainly, it’s a skill that is always useful.Student:Mm-hmm.Yeah, so the assignment was for us to talk about a current environmental solution?And I found so much eye opening information while researching.The only problem is, I don’t know which area to go with.Professor:Okay well, which areas most interest you?Student:Well I’ve spent a lot of time exploring the concept of wind farms.You know, using wind as a source of energy.Professor:Mm-hmm, go on.Student:Right um - lots of stuff on that you know types of wind farms and different designs, how they’ve been set up, how to get the most out of them.Professor:Okay, and what’s another choice?Student:Well, it’s a tie between wind farms and mushrooms.Professor:Mushrooms!?Hm! Tell me more about that!Student:Well, there’s a species of mushrooms that produces chemicals that can eat away at toxic waste - from petroleum products, pesticides and other harmful pollutants.Professor:Yes, I’ve read research about this.But actually, Michael, it’s the fungus beneath the ground that affects the harmful pollutants.That’s an important difference.Student:Oh right, that’s what I meant.I’ll explain it more clearly in class.Professor:Keep it simple.Something like - just like trees produce apples, it’s the funghi that produce mushrooms, and it’s also those funghi that produce the helpful chemicals.Student:I understand.It’s just so amazing that something low cost and already there in nature could solve such a large pollution problem caused by humans.Professor:It is intriguing.Wind farms affect, too, but I think most of your classmates will already be generally familiar with that topic, whereas they might not have heard of this.Student:Okay.Thanks, Professor Williams!Professor:Btw, what’s the growing period for this species?Student:Ah, it only takes a month to grow.Professor:Great!The university has a greenhouse that’s sometimes available for research projects.Why don’t you stop over there one afternoon, speak to the manager and ask if he’d let you use a small area of the greenhouse?Student:Okay.Professor:You could try to duplicate the results of the study!Student:In the greenhouse?Professor:Yes!You have three months until the end of this semester.It might make a strong final project!
