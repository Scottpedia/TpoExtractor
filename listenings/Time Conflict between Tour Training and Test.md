Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee at the university art museum.Student: Hi, is Mason around?Employee: No, sorry he’s gone for the day.Can I help you with something?Student: Well, I hope so.See, I’m supposed to start volunteering as a tour guide on Monday.I’m scheduled to give a tour at ten.I did my first volunteer training session with Mason the other day, and I was supposed to have the second session tomorrow afternoon, which is the last one you guys offer this week, right?Employee: Yes, it is.In fact, it’s the last one we have scheduled for this semester.Student: Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of.So I don’t know what to do because I’m signed up to give that tour on Monday and it turns out I have to make up a test tomorrow afternoon.Employee: Well, yes, that is a problem, I’m afraid, because we do require two training sessions before you’re allowed to start giving tours.Student: Yeah, I know, I was hoping maybe I could work something out with Mason.He gave us his home number at the original training session, but I am not sure where I put it.Could you possibly give it again?Employee: Well, no, I am not allowed to give out employees’ phone numbers.It wouldn’t do you any good, anyway.Mason can’t waive that training requirement any more than I can.But I can sign you up for the first session next semester and you could start giving tours then.Student: That’s too late.Not that I wouldn’t want to do tours next semester.I mean, I do want to keep doing it.It’s just that, see I really need to start this semester.My art history professor is giving me a chance to bring my grade up.He said that I could get extra credit if I wrote a paper for him and volunteered here at the art museum.Employee: Is this Professor Tyler’s class?Student: Uh-huh.Employee: Yeah, I thought so.You’re not the first student that he’s sent our way.Look, did he specify that it had to be a tour guide?Student: Well, not exactly. I just thought…Employee: Because believe me, we could use you in other capacities.Student: Really?Employee: Well, it’s not as glamorous as being a tour guide, but we always need people to work in the museum gift shop, or how are you with data entry, data processing, stuff like that?Student: Pretty good, actually.Employee: Because we desperately someone right away to help us keep our membership list up to date, work on our monthly newsletter, things like that.Sounds kind of boring I know, but after you’ve had some experience, it could lead to a paid position.Student: Well, that’d certainly be a plus.Tell you what? Let me just check with Professor Tyler, make sure it’s alright with him and I will get back to you sometime tomorrow, okay?Employee: Okay, great!
