Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and his sociology professor.Professor: Well, I'm glad you redid your outline.I fed a few comments, but nothing you have to act on.It's in good enough shape for you to start writing your paper.Student: Thanks! At first I was afraid all that prep work would be a waste of time.Professor: Well, especially with a challenging topic like yours: factors leading to the emergence of sociology as an academic discipline.There's just so much history to consider; you could get lost without a solid outline.So did you have a question?Student: Yeah, it's about...you mentioned needing volunteers for a research study?Professor: Yep, it's not my study.It's my colleague's in the marketing department.She needs people to watch various new TV programs that haven't been broadcast yet, then indicate on a survey whether they liked it, why, if they'd watch another episode.It'd be kind of fun plus participants get a $50 gift certificate.Student: Wow, well I like the sound of that.But...so they are trying to predict if the shows are gonna succeed or fail, right, based on students' opinions?Why would they care what we think?Professor: Hey, don't sell yourself short.People your age are a very attractive market for advertisers who promote their products on television.The study is sponsored by a TV network.If enough students don't like the show, the network may actually reconsider putting it on the air.Student: OK, well, how do I sign up?Professor: You just add your name and phone number to this list and check a time slot, although it looks like the only times left are next Monday morning and Thursday evening.Student: Oh, well, I have marketing and economics Monday mornings and Thursday.Professor: OH, you are taking the marketing class?Who's teaching it?Student: It's Professor Largin - Intro to Marketing.He hasn't mentioned the study though.Professor: Oh, well, the marketing department's pretty big.I happen to be friends with a woman who is doing the TV study.Ok, well, we don't want you missing class.How's Thursday?Student: Oh, I work from 5 till 9 that night.Professor: Hmm, no flexibility with your schedule?Where do you work?Student: At Fox's Diner, as a server.Professor: Oh, I love Fox's.I eat there every week.Maybe you could switch shifts with someone.Student: I'm still in training.And the only night my trainer works is Thursday.Professor: Look! I know the owners there really well.Why don't you let me give them a call and explain the situation?Student: OK! It'd be cool to be part of a real research study.And the gift certificate wouldn't hurt either.
