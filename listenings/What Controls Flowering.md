# What Controls Flowering

{The timing of flowering and seed production is {tuned to a plant's physiology
and the {of its environment.● In temperate climate plants lost flower early enough so that their
seeds can mature before the deadly winds of
autumn.● Depending on how quickly the seed and food develop flowering may occur in spring as it does in oaks; in
summer as in lettuces; or even in autumn
as in asters.What
environmental cues do plants use to determine the seasons? ● Most cues such as temperature or water availability are quite variable: autumn can be warm; a late snow could fall in spring; also summer might be unusually cool and wet.● So the only reliable cue is day length: longer days always mean that spring and summer are coming; shorter
days foretell the onset of autumn and winter.{With
respect to flowering botanists classify plants as day neutral, long day or short
day.● A day neutral plant flowers as soon as it has sufficiently grown and developed regardless of the length of
day.● The neutral plants include tomatoes, corn, snapdragons and
{.● {● Short night plantsflower when the length of darkness is shorter than a species' specific critical period.● Long night plantsflower
when the length of uninterrupted darkness is longer than the species' specific critical period.● Thus spinach is classified as a short night plant because it flowers only if the night is shorter than eleven hours, and the cocklebur is a long night plant because it flowers only if an uninterrupted darkness lasts more than 8.5 hours.●
Both of these plants will flower with ten-hour nights.{{Plant scientists can {flowering.● Plant scientists can induce flowering in the cocklebur by exposing leaves to long nightsin a special chamber, while the rest of the plant continues to experience
short nights.● Clearly, a signal
that induces flowering transmitted from the leave to the flowering bud.● Plant physiologists have been attempting for decades to isolate these elusive signaling molecule often called florigen.● Some
researchers believe they are close to demonstrating a flower's stimulating substance for specific type of plant.● Using genetic manipulation, it is likely, however, that interactions among multiple and yet unidentified planthormones stimulate or {flowering, and that these chemicals may differ among plant species.● Researchers have had more success in determining how plants measure the length of
uninterrupted darkness, which is a crucial stimulus for producing whatever
substance control flowering.{To
measure continuous darkness, a plant needs two things: some sort of metabolic clock to measure timeand a light
detecting system to set the clock.● Virtually all organisms have an internal biological clock that measures the time even without environmental cues.● In most organisms including plants, the
biological clock is poorly understood, but we know that the environmental cues, particularly light, can reset the clock.● How do plants detect light?● The light detecting system of plants is a pigment in leaves called phytochrome.{{Plants
seem to use the phytochrome system in combination with their internal biological clocks to detect the duration of continuous darkness.● Cockleburs, for example,
flower under the schedule of sixteen hours of darkness and eight hours of light.● However, interrupting the middle of the dark period with
just a minute or two of lights prevents flowering.● {Thus their flowering
is controlled by the length of continuous darkness.● {It is evident that even
brief exposure to sunlight or white light will reset their biological clocks.● {The color of the light used for the light exposure is also important.● A nighttime flash of pure red
light inhibits flowering, while flash of light at the far-red end of the spectrum has
no effect on flowering, as if no light were detected. {
