Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a Department Secretary.Student: Hi. Miss Handricks.Secretary: Hi Bret, how are you?Student: I’m fine, except I have a question about my paycheck.Secretary: Sure. What’ up?Student: Well, it’s already been several weeks at the end of the semester and my check was supposed to go directly into my bank account but there haven’t been any deposits.Secretary: That’s odd.Student: Yeah, and I thought graduate teaching assistant will automatically put on the payroll at the beginning of the semester.Secretary: They are. Let’s see did you complete all the forms for the payroll?Student: I filled in whatever they sent me, and I returned like the end of August.Secretary: Hum, well, you definitely should have been paid by now.At least two pay periods have passed since then.Student: I asked the bank and they didn’t know anything.Who should I talk to about this, payroll?Secretary: I’m going to contact them for you.There was a problem in processing some of the graduate students’ payroll paper work.‘Cause their computer program crashed after all the information was processed.And some people’s information couldn’t be retrieved.Student: Hum. But why didn’t any one let me know?Secretary: I don’t know how they work over there, ‘cause they couldn’t even figure out whose information was missing.And this isn’t the first time, seems like something like this happens every semester.Student: So how do I find out if my information was lost?Secretary: I will contact them tomorrow morning to see if you’re in the system.But you’re probably not.Student: Well, then let me to do…?Secretary: Sorry, but you will need to fill out those forms again and then I will fax them over the payroll office.Student: And then what… Well, what I really need to know is how long till I get the money.I’m already a month behind my bills and my tuitions due soon.Secretary: They’ll get you into the system the same day they receive your paper works.So if you do that tomorrow, you’ll get paid next Friday.Student: That’s a long time from now.Will that pay checking include all the money I am owed?Secretary: It should. I will double check with the payroll department.Student: And another thing, Is there any way I could get paid sooner?I have been teaching all these weeks…Secretary: I know that’s not fair but I don’t think they can do anything; all the checks are computed automatically in the system.They can’t just write checks.Student: But they are the ones that have made mistakes.And they never told me!Woman: I understand how you feel and if I were you, I’d be upset too.I’ll tell you what: when I call them, I will explain the situation and ask them if there is any way you can be paid sooner.But I have to tell you that base on past experiences, you shouldn’t count on it.Student:I understand, thanks.I know it’s not your fault and that you’re doing everything you can.Secretary: Well, what I can do is: make sure that your first check is for total amount the university owes you.Student: That’ll be great! Thank you.I will be on campus about 10 tomorrow morning and I will come by to see you then.
