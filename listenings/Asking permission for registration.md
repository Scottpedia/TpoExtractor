Listen to part of a conversation between a student and a university employee.Employee: Oh, hello ... can I help you?Student: Um ... yeah ... I’m looking for Professor Kirk; is she here?I mean is this her office?Employee: Yes, you're in the right place-Professor Kirk’s office is right behind me but no ... she's not here right now.Student: Um, do you know when she'll be back?Employee: Well, she’s teaching all morning.She won’t be back until... let me check ... hmm, she won’t be back until... after lunch.That’s when she has her office hours.Perhaps you could come back then?Student: Oh, unfortunately no.I have class this afternoon.And I was really hoping to talk to her today.Hey, um, do you know if... she's accepting any more students into her Introduction to Biology class?Employee: You wanna know if you can take the class?Student: Yes, if she’s letting any more students sign up, I’d like, I’d like to join the class.Employee: Introduction to Biology is a very popular class, especially when she teaches it.A lot of students take it.Student: Yeah, that’s why the registrar said it was full.I’ve got the form the registrar gave me, um, to get her permission to take the class.It's all filled out except for her signature.I’m hoping she’ll let me in even though the class is full.You, see, I'm a senior this year, and, uh …this’ll be my last semester, so it’s my last chance …Employee: Oh, wow, really.I mean most students fulfill their science requirement the first year.Student: Well, I mean, um ... to be honest, I kept putting it off.I’m not really a big fan of science classes in general, and with the labs and everything, I’ve never quite found the time.Employee: Your advisor didn’t say anything?Student: Well, to tell you the truth, she’s been after me to take a class like this for a while, but I’m double-majoring in art and journalism and so my schedule's been really tight with all the classes I gotta take, so somehow I never...Employee: Well, perhaps you could leave the form with me and I’ll see if she'll sign it for you.Student: You know, I appreciate that, but maybe I should explain the problem to her in person …I didn’t want to do it, but I guess I’ll have to send her an email.Employee: Hmm. You know, not all professors check their emails regularly-I …I'm not sure if Professor Kirk does it or not.Here's an idea … why don’t you stick a note explaining your situation under her door and ask her to call you if she needs more information?Student: Hey, that's a good idea, and then I can leave the form with you-if you still don't mind.
