Narrator:Listen to a conversation between a student and a counselor in a career service’s office on campus.Sarah:Hi! I’m Sarah Rodman.I have an appointment with you to talk about possible jobs?And I brought my resume along just in case.Counselor:Hi Sarah, nice to meet you.Yes, we’ll need to have your resume on file, so thanks for bringing it in.Okay, why don’t you start by telling me what kind of job you’re looking for?Sarah:Well, I’m working at a restaurant right now, and that’s okay.But I’d really like to start getting more relevant experience.I’m studying to be a teacher, so - maybe at a childcare centre or something?Counselor:That’s a possibility.Now, a childcare job may pay even less than a restaurant but, it’d certainly be good experience.Especially if you’re going into early childhood education.Are you?Sarah:Uhhhh - I’m not sure yet.Maybe elementary school, but possibly younger ages.Counselor:Well, working at a childcare centre may help you decide.Now, a childcare job could interfere with your schedule if most of your classes during the day.Are you willing to take evening classes if you need to?Sarah:Well, I’d have to guess.That’s what’s been great about the restaurant.I mostly work evening hours.Counselor:Right, now there is a childcare centre right here at the University.Sarah:OH! Where is it?Counselor:Building right behind the main library.It’s a great facility.It’s for students, faculty, and staff who have young children.They prefer to hire students who are majoring in early childhood education.It has morning and afternoon shifts, and they try to accommodate school schedule.Although the more flexible your schedule, the more likely you’ll get hired.So you may need to take an evening class or two.Sarah:Sounds good!Do you know if they have any openings?Counselor:They’re closed now.But, I can get the most up to date information from the director later.I know him well.So why don’t you fill out a general application?You can do it when we finish talking, and leave it with me.Sarah:Okay! No problem!Counselor:And also, you should consider filling out the questionnaire on our website.It’ll give you a better sense of your overall skills and interests, and maybe even help you identify other kinds of jobs you could consider!Sarah:Okay. I’ve never done one of those before!What’s it like?Counselor:Oh you know, it asks questions like, do - do you prefer to work indoors or outdoors?Things like that.For some questions, you really have to think about what you’re good at, and others about what you enjoy.Sarah:Sounds like a great tool!Counselor:It is.Also, our job database has lots of listings of both on and off campus employment.It’d be a good idea for you to look through these, see if any of them might interest you.Once you’ve done that, make a follow-up appointment, and we’ll put it all together.By then I’ll know about openings at the campus childcare centre.Sarah:Great! I really appreciate your help.
