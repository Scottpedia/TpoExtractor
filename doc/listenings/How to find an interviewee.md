Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor.Professor: Sandy, how's class been going for you this semester?Female Student: Oh, it's great.I really like your business psychology class, but I have one major concern about the last assignment: you know-the one where we have to interview a local business owner, uh, I mean entrepreneur?Professor: Are you having trouble coming up with interview questions?Female Student: Well, that‘s just it.I mean I worked on my high school newspaper for years, so I actually have great questions to ask.The thing is I’m new to the area, and I don't know people off campus.So I was wondering if, well, could you possibly give me the name of someone I could interview?Professor: You don’t know anyone who owns a business?Female Student: Well, yeah, back home my next-door neighbors-they own a shoe store, and they’re really successful -but they’re not local.Professor: Well, it wouldn't be fair to the other students if I gave you the name of a contact-but I could help you figure out a way to find someone on your own.Let’s see.Do you read the local newspaper?Female Student: Sure, whenever I have the time.Professor: Well, the business section in the paper often has stories about local business people who’ve been successful.If you find an article, you could call the person who is profiled.Female Student: You mean, just call them up out of the blue and ask them if they‘ll talk to me?Professor: Sure, why not?Female Student: Well, aren't people like that awfully busy?Too busy to talk to a random college student?Professor: Many people enjoy telling the story of how they got started.Remember, this is a business psychology class, and for this assignment, I want you to get some real insight about business owners, their personality, what drives them to become an entrepreneur.Female Student: Like, how they think?Professor: And what motivates them?Why did they start their business?I’m sure they'd talk to you, especially if you tell them you might start a business someday.Female Student: I’m not sure I’d have the guts to do that.Opening a business seems so risky, so scary.Professor: Well, you can ask them if they felt that way too.Now you just need to find someone to interview to see if your instincts are correct.
